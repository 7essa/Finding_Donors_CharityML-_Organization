-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
* **CharityML** is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. _**CharityML is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than $50,000 accurately.**_ Therefore, that what we will do in this project. 
* The project is an course project proviede by [**Udacity**](www.udacity.com) for Machine Learning Nano Degree
