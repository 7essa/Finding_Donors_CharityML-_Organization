# Finding Donors for CharityML :mag: :money_with_wings: :sparkler:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Description
* **CharityML** is a fictitious charity organization located in the heart of Silicon Valley. After nearly 32,000 letters were sent to people in the community, CharityML determined that every donation they received came from someone that was making more than $50,000 annually. To expand their potential donor base, CharityML has decided to send letters to residents of California, but to only those most likely to donate to the charity. _**CharityML is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than $50,000 accurately.**_ Therefore, that what we will do in this project. 

*  The aim of this project is to evaluate and optimize several different supervised learners to determine which algorithm will provide the highest donation yield while also reducing the total number of letters being sent.

* The project is an course project proviede by [**Udacity**](www.udacity.com) for Machine Learning Nano Degree
